## Zoo Function

This project was made at the end of block 8, in which I studied 
_High Order Functions in JavaScript ES6_.

### How It Works

This project consisted in creating several functions to meet the evaluated requirements, all of which needed the knowledge to manipulate __data__ present in arrays and objects. It was also necessary to know _HOFs (High Order Functions)_, especially the native ones of _Java Script_, such as ___forEach, find, some, every, map, reduce and filter___.

Also, it was necessary to read and reflect on the tests created with __Jest__ so that it was possible to understand all the features developed by the functions.
